## Status

  - not documented and tried yet, as I am currently 'dog fooding it' (npi) while building my [website](https://github.com/thlorenz/thlorenz.com)  in
    order to flesh out what exactly to expose as public api and also document
  - at this point be welcome to use it if you don't need documentation
